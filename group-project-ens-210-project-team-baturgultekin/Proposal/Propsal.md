## Tumour protein D52 family

The hD52 gene was originally identified through its elevated expression level in human breast carcinoma. The founding member of the family, human D52, has principally attracted research interest due to its frequent overexpression in cancer, often in association with D52 gene amplification.

The protein that will be used in this project is `tumor protein D52(TPD52)`. This protein was chosen because of frequent overexpression in cancer. In this project `function of protein will be examined` to determine which functions are conserved and the affect of these conservations on human diseases such as breast cancer. Conservations will be analyzed since if a mutation occurs at very conservative region it might cause significant results. While these conservations being analyzed `the function that we write will be used for the determination of conservation score`. Subfamilies will be observed to get answers these questions: `which regions are conserved in each subfamily, and what is the reason of a protein is conserved in a specific subfamily but it is not conserved in other subfamilies`. `Protein domain sequence alignment will be analyzed`, by using these alignment sequences, `domain architecture (in the sense of domain fusion) will be investigated`. In addition, `the phylogenetic tree will be used` to gather information about whether there are paralogous (gene duplications) or orthologous protein domains, by looking branch lengths which domain is closer to ancestor can be found.
