## Course Description

Have you ever considered how the code in each of your cells determines your physical appearance, disease risk, even your behaviors? Do you know why you and the annoying fly buzzing in the middle of the night are unique? Why does a diet work well for you whereas it might not for others? It is all genome! If the genome contains so much information why can't we design person-specific drugs, diets, treatments etc? It is because we don't understand what the code exactly means! Identifying code is no more a barrier, but its analysis is. In this course, we will learn the basics in computational genomics with the aim of gaining fundamentals of bioinformatics applications. We will learn using publically available tools as well as writing custom python scripts in order to answer biological questions. The more details regarding the content, grading and policy can be found below.

## Learning objectives

* Explain why bioinformatics is necessary today at the end of the first week.
* Use UNIX environment to parse genome data files by the end of the second week.
* Write Python scripts to perform basic DNA and protein sequence analyses by the end of the third week.
* Find hypothetical genes in a given DNA sequence by the end of the fourth week.
* Synthesize protein sequence with a given DNA sequence by the end of the fifth week.
* Use regular expressions to find protein motifs and visualize them on protein structure by the end of the sixth week.
* Understand what homology is, how homology information can be used in protein function identification by the end of the seventh week.
* Build and interpret multiple sequence alignments by the end of the eighth week.
* Build, visualize and analyze phylogenetic trees by the end of the ninth week.
* Understand what protein domains are and how they are predicted with a given protein sequence by the end of the tenth week.
* Know a variety of NGS methods and what they are designed for by the end of the twelveth week.
* Build NGS analysis pipelines by the end of the semester.

## Requirements and expectations

* There is no official textbook for the class. Slides will be made available. In order to be successful the best way is in-class learning and taking notes.
* Being active in lectures and lab sessions is encouraged.
* There is NO stupid question. Do not hesitate to ask any question.
* Bring a laptop to every class and lab.
* Late work will not be accepted for the take-home exam.
* Lab work should be completed within lab hours. The assignment system will have a firm deadline unless your instructor (or TA) agrees that extra time is required.

### Honesty
* All the work should be completed personally unless stated otherwise. You will be assigned a single group project where you are expected to collaborate, the rest will be individual assignments. For group assignments, groups may not share their codes, individual are allowed to share their work (code) with other group members only.
* Plagiarism will not be tolerated. This does not mean that you are disallowed to use the internet. However, you may not copy and paste any code from the internet. You need to cite the references/websites properly whenever you get inspired otherwise your work will be treated as plagiarism.
* You are not allowed to share code in any case (except for group assignment). 
* During take-home examination, you are not allowed to exchange ideas with anyone. All private communication is explicitly forbidden. The only platform that you can get some help is Github issues. You can ask your questions by creating an issue on Github.

### Attendance
* Attendance is required. If you are not able to attend, send an e-mail to me and state your excuse **before** the class. Multiple unexcused absences will be considered legitimate for grade reduction.
* Make-ups are only given for in-class midterms and the final examination. A medical report must be brought.

### Group presentations
* At the time of group presentations, you must be present and ready to present your group work in class. One of the group members will randomly be called to give their presentation. The group members will get the same grade based on the submitted work and the presentation.
* Late work will not be accepted.

### Academic Integrity
To uphold with [Sabanci University Academic Integrity Statement](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/academic-integrity-statement)

> I will not lie and cheat in my academic work.

> I will act (by letting the instructor know) if the academic integrity is compromised.

By being registered in this class, you will be assumed to have accepted the rules written in this syllabus.
